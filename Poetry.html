                        Can you see the curvature of the moon?<br>
                        How it shines through nightly gloom?<br>
                        The silver light its fair boon<br>
                        Can you see how it never truly fades?<br>
                        The heavenly beacon it creates?<br>
                        Reflects the lights and never blinds<br>
                        And guides to the brightest days<br>

                        Always standing under this tent<br>
                        Everstanding like there is no time<br>
                        Forever emitting radiant silver shine<br>
                        The horizon for you its only end<br>
                        By the lights you perceive a sign<br>
                        Through travels towards new prime<br>
                        From the Heavens it was send<br>
                        <br>
                        On earth it got a meaning<br>
                        From humans that read the skys<br>
                        Towards them the hope still flies<br>
                        On the ground you lie dreaming<br>
                        Upwards echo silent cries<br>
                        But hopes luminescence never dies<br>
                        New future grows in the gleaming<br>

                    <p>
                        Walking down an empty street<br>
                        Under sky so cloud an starless<br>
                        Moving forward, feet by feet<br>
                        Spilling secrets with no witness<br>
                        Calm and perceptive is the mind<br>
                        Strolling down roads of thought<br>
                        Looking for solutions to find<br>
                        Holding onto what it caught<br>
                        Wandering forward without fear<br>
                        Stepping stones, well known rythm<br>
                        Wondering about eerie atmosphere<br>
                        When sudden surprise enters vision<br>
                        New impulse that makes you stumble<br>
                        Atlas now begins to tumble<br>
                        As knees have become to weak<br>
                        From memories so dark an bleak<br>
                        Balance now becomes a struggle<br>
                        Disrupted by a push so subtle<br>
                        So strong that sight grows blind<br>
                        The search for light is left behind<br>
                        And so begins the grand fall<br>
                        Down into eternal demise<br>
                        But instead find yourself standing tall<br>
                        On horizon northern star arise<br>

                        Electrical Twilight lights an empty street<br>
                        Even Hindsight reveals no solution<br>
                        You will find a crossing where lost souls meet<br>
                        Under stars blind from shining photopollution<br>
                        <br>
                        One bird curious and young leaves its nest<br>
                        A man furious at the world crossed the road<br>
                        Silenced Screams and meaningless words in chest<br>
                        But daring dreams lingering under heavy load<br>
                        <br>
                        Bird entered vision and formed a connection<br>
                        A natural collision of wandering minds<br>
                        For differing awareness but a mirrored reflection<br>
                        In a world careless and cruel still of similar kinds<br>
                        <br>
                        Unsure what life and surroundings are demanding<br>
                        leaving the hive searching for lights in the sky<br>
                        Captured by concrete with no understanding<br>
                        Developments incomplete both unable to fly<br>

                        A fleeting movement to your right<br>
                        Makes you turn in fright<br>
                        Imagination or an omen?<br>
                        You get up to attest<br>
                        Only silence from outside<br>
                        And nothing comes to sight<br>
                        The light flickers another time<br>
                        Then a tick of clock<br>
                        Makes you turn around in shock<br>
                        Standing in this ghostly shine<br>

                        The future still enshrined by frost<br>
                        Through endless white and coldened sun<br>
