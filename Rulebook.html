                        The Midheim Rulebook is a tabletop RPG rulebook written by me. On 160 pages you can find a flexible, classless levelbased rulebook that focuses on free character development and a combat system that is highly tactical.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Combat is based around 300 Manoeuvres, abilities that are tied to weapon types. With a  fluid action economy players can easily combine Manoeuvres to unleash devastating Combos or tenacious Defences. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Manoeuvres have been balanced in such a  way that each weapon type (of which there are 13 available) has uniques playstyles available that are equally powerful and each fill their own nieche. Choose yourself if you want to be a Support Tank that isolates enemies, a ranged Assasin that eliminates the important tagets, a flanking Damage Dealer that attacks from the shadows or a Shield Tank that protects their allies.
